# Credit-Card-Spending-Analysis
## Transactions extracted from TD Bank Credit Card Statements:

- Developed a script to review, extract, and clean the personal credit card spending history using Pandas.
- Created a pivot table to summarize the maximum, average, and total spending per month per year from 2019 to 2021.
- Designed a bar plot to map the maximum, average, and total spending per month per year from 2019 to 2021 to clearly visualize credit card spending patterns.
- One important observation was that spending was at its highest in March 2020.
